\section{Problem Representation}

\subsection{Representation Description}
% describe how you design the state representation, the possible actions, the reward table and the probability transition table

We generate a possible set of states, each with either

\begin{itemize}
	\item The current city, a task and the destination city of the task.
	\item The current city and without a task.
\end{itemize}

From each of these state we can have either

\begin{itemize}
	\item If we have task, move to the destination city. 
	\item If we don't have a task, we go to the neighbooring city which
		has the best potential reward, the reward of a package minus
		the cost of travelling there. Cost itself is defined by the
		distance to the city times the cost per kilometer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}
% describe the implementation details of the representations above and the implementation details of the reinforcement learning algorithm you implemented

For each possible state, we find the possible actions (for exemple, we can't
deliver if we don't have a task), then for each, we compute the best reward and
add it to the generated map. Then, we do it over and over (for each path), until
the map stabilize, meaning that there is no more better value.

\section{Results}
% in this section, you describe several results from the experiments with your reactive agent

\subsection{Experiment 1: Discount factor}
% the purpose of this experiment is to understand how the discount factor influences the result

\subsubsection{Setting}
% you describe how you perform the experiment (you also need to specify the configuration used for the experiment)

\subsubsection{Observations}
% you describe the experimental results and the conclusions you inferred from these results

\subsection{Experiment 2: Comparisons with dummy agents}
% you compare the results of your agent with two dummy agents: the random agent that was already given in the starter files and another dummy agent that you define and create. You should report the results from the simulations using the topologies given in the starter files and optionally, additional topologies that you create.

\subsubsection{Setting}
% you describe how you perform the experiment and you describe the dummy agent you created (you also need to specify the configuration used for the experiment)

\subsubsection{Observations}
% elaborate on the observed results
